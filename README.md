# PrancingPony

The Prancing Pony is an inn in the village of Bree (this is somewhere in Middle-earth). It’s also, where Frodo first mit Strider (aka
Aragorn, Son of Arathorn).

Sadly this program is no longer pony-powered, but got an upgrade to Rails. Nobody can stop the technical progress and steam-powered
engines is what is now state-of-the-art.

Anyway. It still serves us (MetaMeute) best as a counter in nearly all meanings of the word. It counts and fresh beverages are served
with it’s help to fulfill the needs of thirsty geeks.
